# Sakurasou - Deprecated

Sakurasou is an exceptional online platform designed to assist Japanese language learners on their journey to master the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). With a vast collection of questions spanning from N5 to N1 levels, Sakurasou provides a powerful resource for those seeking to enhance their Japanese proficiency.

One of the key aspects that sets Sakurasou apart is its commitment to open-source development. The project is licensed under the MPL-2.0 license, which promotes collaboration and encourages contributors to improve the codebase and expand the question database. By fostering a community-driven approach, Sakurasou aims to provide the most accurate, up-to-date, and diverse set of questions for JLPT preparation.

We invite language enthusiasts, developers, and Japanese learners from around the world to actively participate in the project. Your contributions, regardless of your level of experience, can have a significant impact on the growth and success of Sakurasou. Whether you have suggestions for code optimization, improvements in user experience, or additional questions to enrich the database, your contribution will be highly valued and appreciated.

Maintaining and expanding Sakurasou is a straightforward process. The project is built using fundamental web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the popular Tailwind CSS framework. This combination of technologies ensures simplicity, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. Even if you are new to the project, the well-structured codebase and clear documentation will make your onboarding process smooth and enjoyable.

By joining the Sakurasou community, you become part of a dynamic and passionate group of individuals dedicated to supporting Japanese language learners on their path to success. Together, we will transform Sakurasou into the ultimate training resource for JLPT, empowering students to achieve their language goals and fostering a greater appreciation for the Japanese language and culture.
